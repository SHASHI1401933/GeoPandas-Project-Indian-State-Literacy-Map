# GeoPandas-Project-Indian-State-Literacy-Map
The project integrates a vector boundary file (India states GeoJSON) with a tabular CSV of Census 2011 literacy rates to produce a choropleth map using GeoPandas and Matplotlib, with a visual highlight for states under the national mean. It reinforces geospatial joins, thematic mapping, and legend/annotation design using standard GeoPandas pattern.
